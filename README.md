Hello There!
Maybe You are just a User or You are an HR manager. Anyway, Welcome! Nice to meet You!
I am Vsevolod and at the moment (end of October 2022) I am a teacher in ordinary public school in little Russian town.
I am 28 now and I want to change my life because of my current situation.
My first try to meet programming was in 2010, I think, with a book about TurboPascal and a CD with SDK. Unfortunately, I didn't think about my future profession and I didn't have enough patience to struggle with difficulties and I gave up and forgot about IT for long years.
In August 2022 I met a really interesting video about Programming and possibilities for people who would like to join IT world. I am really drived doing this. It's not about money but about Dream! And CathingDreams become true only with hardworking. And I am trying right now.

I hope, there are no only Calculator and ToDoList here.
Step by step I want to impove my skills and you can see it by watching my GitHub.
Thank you for reading it!
